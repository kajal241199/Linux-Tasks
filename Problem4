PROBLEM 4:
Create a shell script to check and create users in linux

    1.run shell script /opt/prob5.sh if user is present then it will print message "user is already present in this OS"
    2.if user is not present then it will create that user with password
    3.if not argument given after the script then it must send output "please pass a username"
    4.if run /opt/prob5.sh with more than one argument then it must print "more than one user is not allowed"
SOLUTION:
1.creating shell script
$ vim  /opt/prob5.sh

#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
        getent passwd $1 > /dev/null 2&>1 && (echo yes; exit 0) || (echo no; exit 2)
else
        echo "missing username"
        exit -1
fi
