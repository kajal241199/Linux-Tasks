PROBLEM 1:
Write shell script

    shebang must be /bin/bash
    make this executable
    shell script name /opt/prob1.sh
    if we run like "/opt/prob1.sh hello" it must give output "DelVex"
    if we run like "/opt/prob1.sh delvex" it must give output "Hello"
    if we run with anyother argument except above then it must give output "/opt/prob1.sh Hello Delvex"
    if we don't give any arguments then it must give out "/opt/prob1.sh not found"

SOLUTION:
1.create a shell script:- /opt/prob1.sh
vim /opt/prob1.sh

[/opt/prob1.sh]

#!/bin/bash
if  [  $1 == "Delvex"  ]
then
      echo "Hello"
elif  [  $1 == "Hello"  ]
then
      echo "Delvex"
elif  [  $1 ==   ]
then
      echo "/opt/prob1.sh not found"
else
      echo "/opt/prob1.sh Hello Delvex"
fi

2.making it executable
chmod +x /opt/prob1.sh
